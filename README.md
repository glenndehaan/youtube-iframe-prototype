# Youtube Iframe Prototype

An prototype used to see how the Youtube Iframe API works

## Structure
- ES5
- Webpack Dev Server

## Usage
I'm using Docker to run a dev version off the prototype.
To start using this prototype download the latest version of Docker.
Then run the build_docker.sh file and you are off to the races.

Open Kitematic to see the webpack build progress.

Then open up your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:3001/
That's it. Easy right?
